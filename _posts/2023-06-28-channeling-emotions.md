# Struggling
Last Wednesday was the happiest day of my life. It seemed as if nothing could change that fact, yet a week later, I am at my most miserable, and it's all downhill from here. No matter how much I tried to get my feelings out, they seemed to always come back. Thus, I asked myself, where do I pour these emotions?

## Writing
For a long time, **writing** is where I would turn to vent, and where my emotions have a place to manifest themselves. Quite evident from the existence of this blog in fact! I had created
* Diaries
* Journals
* Blogs
  
yet none of them were quite satisfying to me, for a simple reason. **My writing will never be seen**. I used to write my diary with the thought of eventually reading it with her one day, and although that may still be possible, it will be years from now until this dream is even possible of being fulfilled, so I have noone do direct my writings too.

Without that, the words with my emotions are contained in the journal, and it cannot get out. I still very much writing the words down whenever you feel like it, and a blog is a good way to find purpose in your writings while also having everything be directed at yourself.

## Friends
Before, whenever I was going through difficult emotions, I would always vent to her. That isn't exactly possible anymore, and the thought of the aforementioned possibility is also what's making my time so difficult right now. However, venting to friends and to those you love are great ways to get your emotions off your chest while also recieving valuable advice, as long as you're able to find a **good listener**. 

Most people seem to disregard this advice, but **venting** is a lot more effective than one would realize. The more you try to put up a positive facade, *the more you feeds to this self fulfilling prophecy, where you bury your true thoughts and deal with them alone. Never deal with your emotions alone*, find people who support you! Find a therapist, call the [Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/), go on random venting [Discord servers](https://disboard.org/servers/tag/venting), dump it all out on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/), or the best course of action is simply to approach a friend.

You don't have to deal with emotions alone, so don't. You don't have to put up a positive facade, so don't. The more you embrace the sadness, the more you'll overcome it.

> Stay Strong!

## Music
One way I liked to express my feelings was through **music**. In middle school, everyday was incredibly lonely to me, and I was into anime, so Japanese Rock/Pop became what helped me. The main theme of these songs are loneliness, depression, and a lot of darker topics that are quite prevalent within the Vocaloid and Utaite communities, which mirrored my emotions at that time. Songs like [Deathly Loneliness Attacks](https://youtu.be/KhV57_EH3AA) and animes *mirrored my loneliness* and helped me get my feelings out.

Then, my happiest days I was listening to hip-hop. I bounced to Snoop Dogg's [Doggystyle](https://open.spotify.com/album/5IFOummNcGXY3qCBWRchqP?si=27meBYyCR1m03CQfp40-og), cried to Kendrick Lamar's [Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers](https://open.spotify.com/album/79ONNoS4M9tfIA1mYLBYVX?si=Ip7z-yquTzC67iE4AmJF1A), and felt inspired by Kanye West's [Graduation](https://open.spotify.com/album/4SZko61aMnmgvNhfhgTuD3?si=83GptDTzQbOC_ULimWzD7Q)]. West's [I Wonder](https://open.spotify.com/track/7rbECVPkY5UODxoOUVKZnA?si=9097a23394f4404c) gave me the motivation to keep on moving forward and inspired me, and Kendrick's [Auntie Diaries](https://open.spotify.com/track/1uY1X8YeBixs1FdQ3fQ7d4?si=7048363983574167) and [The Blacker The Berry](https://open.spotify.com/track/5Mtt6tZSZA9cXTHGSGpyh0?si=d6f3a492b1524377) is what inspired my activism for both the LGBTQ+ community and people in color.  

Now, I find myself at a **loss for songs**. There are so many forms of music out there, but it feels like none of them conveys the *speficic situation* I am in, and none of them describes my emotions as well as I do. So, I booted up **Garageband**, and with a handful of Youtube tutorials I began producing. I wrote songs that portrayed my emotions, I made music that made me tear up when hearing it, and although they are far from professional, they are the emotions I am experiencing. I can't put them in words sometimes, but I can put them in music.

# What Should I Do?

Manifesting your emotions through a hobby is what one should strive to do. For me, those are **music, programming, and website development**. My rage against the injustices of the world led to the creation of [the Transfemme Wiki][(http://transfem.wiki/)], and my loneliness and hopelessness lead me to create this website as a source of both advice and comfort. 

Just know that even in your darkest days, you're not alone. Go to friends and family for comfort. Plus, the internet fosters communities, and the one calling out to you is somewhere in there, you just have to go find it. 

> Don't focus on what you could have done, focus on what you need to do.
