        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>I made this website quite a while back, as sort of a online journal to keep me sane. As expected, I've so far made only a singular entry, but I now wish to revive this project. Both to hone my rudimentary html skills, and to serve as an outlet for me.</p>
        <h2>Why Wednesday?</h2>
        <p>Wednesday is <i>quite</i> a special day for me, being the day of the shitstorm that inspired me to make this website, the last day I had irl with my gf, the day I probably look forward the most in the week, and more. Also, I usually post here <b>every Wednesday</b>, look out for that!</p>
        <h2>Posts</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <ul class="posts">
                <li><a href="posts/2023-11-20.html">2023-11-20</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h2>And before you ask,</h2>
        <p>Yes, you should make a journal like this too. This was great for my mental health and for when I needed somewhere to rant. You don't even need html for this, just use Jekyll or Eleventy, then you can just <i>write</i>.</p>
