        <h2>Channeling emotions</h2>
        <p>
            When I first wrote this back in June 28, I said, "last Wednesday was the happiest day of my life."
            To me, it seemed as if nothing could change that fact, yet a week later, I was at my most miserable, and it seemed like it was all downhill from there.
            "No matter how much I tried to get my feelings out, they seemed to always come back. Thus, I asked myself, where do I pour these emotions?"
        </p>
        <p>
            For a long time, writing is where I would turn to vent, and where my emotions have a place to manifest themselves. 
            Quite evident from the existence of this blog in fact! I had created
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>diaries</li>
            <li>journals</li>
            <li>blogs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Yet none of them were satisfying to me, simply because I knew that my writings will never be seen.
            Writing in a publishable medium like the one you are looking at right now creates an <i>outlet</i>
            for such emotions, and lets them escape. You could also write in a diary, but I find that less effective
            for the aforementioned reasons (unless you're planning to show the diary to somebody one day).
        </p>
        <p>
            Venting to friends and to those you love are great ways to get your emotions off your chest while also recieving valuable advice.
            For me, it served as a temporary bandaid during my time of need, but I still believe that if you're friends with a good listener,
            venting definitely helps immensely with what's going on. You don't have to deal with emotions alone, so don't!
            Try and embrace the sadness in a sense. The more you do that, the more you'll get over it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next thing that helped me was music. This could be any form of art for you, but instead of passively consuming it, learn to create it yourself.
            The goal is to express your emotions, to get them out there, to embrace it, as only then can you truly leave it behind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Good luck out there!
